## Project Setup

Currently this project uses an SQLite DB, so there is no extra setup needed for that.
You can just use the build-in PHP server or any other PHP environment of your choosing.


- Copy `.env.dist` to `.env`
- run `bin/console broadway:event-store:schema:init` to initialize the event store
